# Twitch Channel Points Collector
This browser extension automatically collects channel points while watching streams on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv).

## But why?
Twitch repeatedly rewards its users with channel points after watching streams for a certain time. These points can be used to unlock additional features like exclusive emotes. Unfortunately, users have to click a button manually to claim these points. This circumstance draws the user's attention away from the actual stream and makes Twitch a less enjoyable experience. The presented extension aims to ease the process by collecting channel points automatically in the background as soon as they are available.
